# Interpreter Pattern

- It's helpful when you need to evaluate or interpret a language or expression.
- Some examples are:

  - Programming languages compilers, interpreters, and parsers.
  - HTML, XML, and similars
  - Numerical expressions (e.g., 1 + 2 Ã— 3)
  - Regular expressions

- The interpreter turns strings into objects and vice versa.
